## Problem Statement 
To create a terminal-based Rocket Launch Simulator. The goal is to simulate a rocket launch that places a satellite into orbit, while providing real-time updates to the user. The simulator will operate in discrete time steps, each representing one second of the mission.


## Technology
* Programming Language  - **Rust**

## How To Run 
* Go to the root directory of the folder in terminal. For example "C:\some_folder\rocket_launch_simulator".
* After that type "cargo run" in terminal.

## User Input
1. "start_checks" :  to initiate system checks. 
2. "launch" : to begin the mission after checks are complete.
3. "fast_forward X" : to advance the simulation by X seconds. (X must be a number)

## Conclusion
* All the functional requirements have been satisfied.
* All the exception handling have been covered.
* Code is highly self explanatory and easy to understand.
* Changes can be made as per requirement.
